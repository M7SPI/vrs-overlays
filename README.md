## Overlays and controls for Virtual Radar Server using Leaflet maps

This JavaScript code is a plugin for the ADSB aircraft tracking [Virtual Radar Server](http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk) software. The Javascript files need to be used with the Virtual Radar Server [Custom Content plugin](http://www.virtualradarserver.co.uk/Documentation/CustomContent/Default.aspx).

Note that this is the first code that I have written and published on GitHub. I'm not a professional programmer, rather was interested to try and put something together for personal use but realised that there is some demand from the wider community for this. I'm sure there's better or more efficient ways of writing the code, and further improvements that can be made to include additional features. Therefore I welcome constructive feedback and pull requests to improve and/or add further features.

For the weather overlays to work you will need to sign up for an API code from [Aeris Weather](https://www.aerisweather.com/signup/developer/) and then insert it into the 'Put this file at end of body' file.
